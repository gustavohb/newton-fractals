# Newton Fractal Explorer #

This is Java code for an application which enables visualization of fractals generated using Newton's method. It only supports simple polynomials with maximum degree of 9 with non negative integer exponents and real coefficients.

## About

Newton fractals are a visual representation of a process called the Newton's method used to find the roots (or zeroes) of a function, ![f(z_n)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f%28z_n%29).
This method starts with a guess ![z0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z_0) and then iterates the following expression until the values either converge or fail to converge:

<center>
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z_%7Bn&plus;1%7D%20%3D%20z_n%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7Bf%28z_b%29%7D%7Bf%27%28z_n%29%7D)
</center>

where ![zn](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z_n) is n-th guess root point, ![f(z_n)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f%28z_n%29) is function value at ![zn](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z_n), ![f'(z_n)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f%27%28z_n%29) is function's derivative value at ![zn](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z_n). You use this expression like this: first you guess a possible root and define it as ![z0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z_0), then you use this expression and obtain ![z1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z_1), now you can check precision of guessed root ![dz=|z_1-z_0|](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?dz%20%3D%20%7Cz_1%20-%20z_0%7C), if ![dz](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?dz) satisfies you then you can claim that ![z1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z_1) is root with precision ![dz](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?dz). Note that you can iterate as long as you want, the more iterations the more precise root you get. However, for every polynomial of degree at least 2 there are points for which the Newton's method does not converge to any root.

The approximate value ![z0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z_0) chosen at the beginning of the process, determines to which root you will eventually converge.

This method works with complex numbers, which naturally lend themselves to 2D images. A complex number ![z=x+yi](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z%20%3D%20x%20&plus;%20i%20%5Ccdot%20y) can be represented as a point on a 2D plane with coordinates ![x](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x) and ![y](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?y), or alternatively as a pair ![(x,y)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%28x%2C%20y%29).

If we assign each root a color, and we color each point on the complex plane based on the root to which that point converges, a Newton fractal is the result.

In this program, the number of iterations Newton's method takes to converge determines the brightness of a pixel at a particular point (the brighter pixel the faster it reaches root). Therefore the brightest pixels are root regions.
